        <p class="samar">Drawing is one of the most favourite hobbies among children all around the world. That's why a trend of essay writing on the hobby of drawing is always noticed in various examinations all around the world. Because of that, we have decided to come up with such a session that will show the proper method of writing essays on drawing hobby.I am a student of class 6. All my friends have something as their hobby. My hobby is drawing pictures. I love to draw since when I was in class 2. As my drawing teacher, I admire Mr. Swapan Saha from whom I’ve learned the basics of drawing. I love to draw natural sceneries as well as figures.

            My teacher always says that nature should be the ultimate inspiration for any painter. That’s why all of us should try to draw pictures not only from drawing books but also from our own. I always try to follow all the advice of my teacher. In the future, I want to be a painter like Swapan Sir.</p>
